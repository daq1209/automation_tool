# ⚠️ IMPORTANT - READ ONLY

## About php.txt File

The `php.txt` file in this directory is **READ-ONLY and for REFERENCE PURPOSES ONLY**.

### ❌ DO NOT:
- Edit this file expecting changes to take effect
- Use this file as the source of truth for the code snippet
- Deploy or copy this file directly to WordPress

### ✅ ACTUAL Code Snippet Location:

The **REAL code snippet** is installed and managed **directly on the WordPress website** via:
- **WordPress Admin Panel** → Plugins → Code Snippets
- Or via `functions.php` theme file
- Or as a custom plugin

### Purpose of php.txt:
- 📖 Reference for Antigravity AI to understand the API structure
- 🔍 Quick lookup for endpoint definitions
- 📝 Documentation of current implementation

---

**IMPORTANT:** 
When you need to make changes to the API endpoints or PHP logic:
1. Log into the WordPress admin panel
2. Navigate to the code snippet manager
3. Edit the **POD Automation API (V12.5 Enterprise)** snippet there
4. After editing on WordPress, update this `php.txt` file to reflect the changes (for documentation purposes only)

**DO NOT** edit `php.txt` first and expect it to sync to WordPress - it won't!
